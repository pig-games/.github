# Welcome to P.I.G
P.I.G stands for Politically Incorrect Games, but don't worry if you're sensitive, it is only mildy 'incorrect' and in a good natured way.

P.I.G is currently a one man hobby project that focusses on developing retro games (and tools and sometimes even hardware) for the F256Jr/K New Retro Computers. Perhaps other developers will at some point join in on the fun.

Current developments:
* [C64OS Presenter](https://github.com/pig-games/C64OSPresenter): a simple presentation program for [C64OS](https://c64os.com).
* [opForge](https://github.com/pig-games/opForge): Multi-target Assembler with expressions, directives, and preprocessor macros.
* [opForge465](https://github.com/pig-games/opForge465): A native (on-device) Editor/Assembler for the (enhanced) C64 family computers
* [opFoundry](https://github.com/pig-games/opFoundry): A cross-development GUI IDE for 65xx-based retro computers, featuring a built-in 6502 emulator, WebSocket bridge for tooling integration, and WASM support for browser-based development.
* [opFoundryCore](https://github.com/pig-games/opFoundryCore): A reusable 6502 emulator core and runtime SDK for retro development tools.
* [YAM3G](https://github.com/pig-games/yam3g): yet another match 3 game (in development).
* Steam Punch: a Steam Punk fighting game, featuring giant steam driven mecha (design and concept fase).
* Development tools:
  - [pngtotile](https://github.com/pig-games/pngtotile): a simple commandline for converting png images to bin files suitable for tiles, sprites or plain bitmaps.
* [Custom F256Jr system case](https://github.com/pig-games/F256-Jr-System-Case) and RaspberryPi (or other SBC) Developer machine companion case.
* [F256 Showcase](https://github.com/pig-games/F256Showcase): a demo/presentation framework for quick creation and playback of guess... demos/presentations.
* A joypad controller matching the F256Jr system case design.
